`#Eyes Tracking Mouse - Three.js`

This is a simple WebGL demo that showcases a pair of 3D eyes that follow the mouse pointer. It utilizes the Three.js library for WebGL-based 3D rendering and the jQuery library for mouse tracking.

`###Demo`

You can check out a live demo of the project here.

`#Features`

Realistic 3D eyes that track the mouse movement.
Phong Material rendering for realistic shading and reflection effects.
Dynamic lighting with multiple light sources.
Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following:

A local web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) or a web development environment (e.g., Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension).
A modern web browser with WebGL support (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

`#Getting Started`
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Download or clone the source code repository.
Start a local web server and point it to the project directory.
Open a web browser and navigate to the local server address.
Here's an example using the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code:

Install the Live Server extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace.
Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
Right-click on the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server".
The project will automatically open in your default web browser.

`#Usage`

Move your mouse within the browser window, and you will see the 3D eyes tracking the movement of the mouse pointer. The eyes will rotate and follow the mouse cursor in real-time.

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different settings to create your own custom effects and visuals.

`#Dependencies`

The project relies on the following libraries:

Three.js - A JavaScript library for WebGL-based 3D graphics.
jQuery - A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
The necessary library files are already included in the project, so there's no need to manually download them.
